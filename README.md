#Facial Awareness

For my openFrameworks final I created a virtual ball interaction for users to play in order to evoke feelings of an augmented reality as well as an understanding of the intertwinement of the natural and the artificial. 

I used the ofxOpenCv add-on for this project in order to detect faces. The openCV add-on allows the interaction to be more accessible to users because it only requires the use of a laptop and its camera. 

The next step for this project would be to use either the blob tracker add-on or facial tracker to create a more accurate interaction with the balls in the screen. I think I would also like to learn how to use Box2D in the future to incorporate physics into the project. I had issues trying to mesh openCV with Box2D, but I would like to experiment further.

I used a few online sources for this project, but my classmates were most helpful.
